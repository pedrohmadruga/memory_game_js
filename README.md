# 🧠 Memory Game — HTML | CSS | JavaScript

A simple yet fun **Memory Card Game** built with pure web technologies — no external libraries.  
This project is part of my journey as a fullstack developer taking on the challenge of improving my **frontend skills**.

## 🎮 How to Play

Flip the cards and match all pairs in the shortest time possible.
Once all pairs are found, a victory modal appears showing your final time. You can start a new game at any moment.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `index.html` — game layout and modal
- `style.css` — general styles, animations, and responsiveness
- `script.js` — game logic, timer, shuffling, and state control
- `images/` — card face images used as background

✅ In-game **timer** that tracks play time  
✅ Pair detection using **DOM manipulation**
